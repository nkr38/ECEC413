# ECEC413 - Parallel Computer Architecture

This is my code from ECEC413. Do try not copy this code, it will infect your computer with dark magic (It only hurts you in the end).

ECEC413 tought us how to develop parallel algorithms for shared-memory parallel computers using pthreads and OpenMP programming. We also learned how to develop parallel algorithms for the graphics processing unit (GPU) and how to implement them using the CUDA programming interface. This course introduced us to the architecture of GPUs and furthered our understanding of CPUs.
